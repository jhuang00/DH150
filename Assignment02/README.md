## User Pilot Test (LAPL website)

### Introduction

The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) website is an official site that gathers all online functions of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The site allows LAP Public Library's patrons to access the Library Catalog, checking the location and availability of books. It also directs users to the e-Media, different events, various resources, etc. During qurantine due to the pandemic, the online site provides maximized availability to the services of LAPL to its users.

This usability test especially focuses on some usability issues found from the heuristic evaluation. First and foremost, in terms of *aesthetic and minimalist design*, the LAPL website provides too much information on a page, which makes the user easily get confused or lose their focus. Also, the design is quite old-fashioned compared to modern design trends. It does not provide a visually pleasing experience to users, which can cause fatigue. Second, information is rather cluttered and not listed in the clearest way; therefore, the site lacks a *match between the system and the real world*. It should make information appear in a more natural and logical order. Third, the website should enhance the *flexibility and efficiency of use*. It should increase the visibility of each function and differentiate levels of information.

Based on these heuristic problems, I have designed 3 tasks for the usability testing to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the LAPL website. The tasks are briefly on:
* Find books in the Catalog: Search for relevant books on "neuroplasticity" in the LAPL catalog for location and availability
* Find library-hosted events: Look for specific information on a coding class for kids
* View library recommendations: Look into the "Love Poetry" book list in the section "LAPL Reads"

More detailed descriptions of the tasks are in the usability test survey, including guiding steps to the tasks. The usability test would enable me to determine the level of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction that the LAPL website brings to the user while completing the specific tasks.

#### Methodology

This usability test is a pilot test, the purpose of which is to find out the user experience of the website and how to improve it. The pilot test took place online. The setting is a portable minimalistic lab where I, as the moderator, conducted the usability test at home with the participant in her home. We used Zoom, a telecommunication application with recording functions to conduct and record the session. The participant was asked to do the usability test for the LAPL website (lapl.org) with given instructions on a web browser and complete the UT survey (see next section) on her personal computer. After signing the informed consent, the participant answered some basic background questions, took a pre-test questionnaire, and then performed three tasks testing for usability. Towards the end of the session, the participant completed a post-test questionnaire. The video recording (see next section) recorded the screen with the mouse movement and captured the participant's reactions and facial expressions while completing the tasks.

### Reflection

I need to pratice more to be a better moderator. There may not be enough communication
After I ended the recording, the participant and I talked more about how did she feel using the website and doing those tasks. 
Write a short paragraph about:
what you learned during the pilot test, 
what went well and what went not so well 
how you want to improve your UT in the future
