### Reflection

Compared to the usability testing, I think contextual inquiry allows us to understand more about the background and context, so that we can have a more comprehensive and holistic view of the 

Because we are designing a product focusing on middle-age women as a user group, I found a participant who is a middle-age female. Through talking with the participant and observing her activities, I was able to gain more understanding of their mindset. For example, people who are younger, including me, are often more 'tech-savvy' and can be more adaptive to new websites or APPs easily. However, there are many people that need more guidance and more time dealing with digital platforms. Therefore, it is very important to make sure the design is user-friendly across all user groups. For a library system that offers service to users across all demographics, it is crucial to ensure accessiblity and compatibility.


quiry process felt a lot more fluid and natural than usability testing, most likely because this was more about what, why, and how a user does an activity and less about a particular product. Asking and observing the user gave me a lot of interesting insight. For example, I did not expect the user to want to log a book as a creative outlet. It was also interesting to find out that part of the motivation for recording books was to recommend them to other people. Unfortunately, I had to use the same participant as my usability test (due to stay-at-home orders because of COVID-19), but I was still able to find a lot of new perspectives about what a user is looking for when he/she is looking for a book and keeping track of it. Another difficulty was I was not sure if there was response bias. Because the participant had been a part of the usability test and knew what kind of product I was examining, maybe she knew what kind of answers I wanted for these questions. In addition, some of my questions may have been biased and could have tried to lead the user to answer a certain way. For example, I gave examples of answers in my questions (e.g. "How would you judge a book? Do you look at the summary, the cover, the author...?"), which may have led to some biased answers. Next time, I want to be really aware of the questions I am asking to try to prevent any kind of bias. I would also want to ask a different person for my contextual interview, and possibly ask multiple people from my target user group.
