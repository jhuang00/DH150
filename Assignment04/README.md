# Contextual Inquiry — User in Context
## Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 4 — Jane Huang

### Introduction

#### Main Design Challenge

The project would support the users' needs of finding the information of books or other education and recreational contents in a library system virtually and digitally.

The activity involves the needs of esteem and self-actualization, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These are the higher levels of needs, as books and other contents a library offers provide 'mental nourishments,' which can satisfy individuals internally. Individuals can not only gain knowledge, but also happiness, fulfillment, and internal peace.

The traditional solutions to satisfy the needs are more involved with the physical world, and less so in a digital setting. For example, in order to find a book they are interested in, individuals would normally have to visit a library, etc. to find the item in person, or get help from a specialist. To explore more options, one would need to rely on the recommendation from an acquaintance, or rely on luck.

However, with digital technology, books and other contents are much more easily accessed by people in the society. A website or an APP on the phone allows users to explore their options effectively. They would be able to find out a book that may be of interest to them (through book lists and recommendations on the web), find out where it is available (through catalogs), and in what forms it is available in (physical book, e-book, or audiobook). These can be done on one's own as long as the product is well designed.

#### Target Users

The target users are people across all demographics, and users should not need any level of expertise about the subject for using the product. Specifically, users who are interested in books or educational contents that the library offers are the target users, and they usually look for a means of personal development, self-education and education for others, or recreation, etc. The project focuses on the user group, middle-age females, and the product should be designed to be accessible to them.

The users would usually do the activity at home, or at their work place. The setting would mostly be in a comfortable and close-to-life setting. This is related to the needs that the activity satisfies, since it is rarely associated with basic needs of individuals. Therefore, the context of use is often non-urgent.

The goal of a user is to find the information they need for a particular book they have in mind, or the information of a potential book they are interested in. They will go through the searching process, through which they can find detailed information about the book including the format, the availability, and the location. They can perform actions such as placing a hold, or adding the book to their list in the library system.

#### Research Methods

I used participatory observation and interview as the research methods for this contextual inquiry study. To begin with, I employed the interview method and ask background questions to the participant. I asked about her experience with library-related topics including her previous experience with books, and her impression on libraries. I mainly used the method of observation in the middle of the study when I asked the participant to participate in some user activities on the website and the APP. Her behaviors for the activities were screen-recorded. Finally, the participant were asked some follow-up questions in an interview format. They tend to be more specifically about the activity or the product, such as how the user would rate the product, whether there were difficulties encountered during the activities, and how the user experience was.

### Reflection

The contextual inquiry provides me insights for the design of the LAPL product. Compared to the usability testing, I think contextual inquiry allows us to understand more about the background and context, so that we can have a more comprehensive and holistic view of the usability design for the product. Because we are designing a product focusing on middle-age women as a user group, I found a participant who is a middle-age female. We used mandarin, allow the participant to use her first language to discuss freely. Through talking with the participant and observing her activities, I was able to gain more understanding of their mindset. For example, people who are younger, including me, are often more 'tech-savvy' and can be more adaptive to new websites or APPs easily. However, there are many people that need more guidance and more time dealing with digital platforms. Therefore, it is very important to make sure the design is user-friendly across all user groups. For a library system that offers service to users across all demographics, it is crucial to ensure accessiblity and compatibility. Regarding the process, I think I can improve on being unbiased, as I might have included some of my assumptions when asking the participant questions later in the session. I thought the participant might be too positive on the product and not giving enough constructive criticisms, so I pushed her to think more about the issue of the design based on my observations, which can potentially lead to biases.
