# Heuristic Evaluation
## Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 1 — Jane Huang

# Feeding the Mind

With the COVID-19 pendemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing unstability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.

## Analysis of Website: [Los Angeles Public Library](lapl.org)

The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is a public library system that serves residents in LA, serving the largest population among all publicly funded library systems in the United States of over 18 million residents. Holding more than 6 million volumes, the LAPL system provides books, zines, periodicals, computer access, and audiovisual materials freely to the residents. The LAPL website contains information digitally that can be accessed and viewed by the users.

The LAPL website needs to be accessible and easy to understand for all users, including middle-aged women, the users we are focusing on — middle-aged women.

In the heuristic evaluation, I will use Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design for this analysis.
I will use severity ratings to aid the heuristic evaluation. 

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation (from [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/))
The severity of usability problems can be rated from a 1 to 3 scale as follows:
Rating  | Importance  |
:---: | :---  |
1  | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
2  | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  |
3  | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority  |


#### Usability Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status
>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**Rating: 2**
* The website has appropriate and prompt response when the user hovers over something that is clickable. For example, the menu would expand when the user hovers over a tab. A tab would change color to show its responsiveness. A link would be underlined to show it is clickable.
* However, the user needs to be have experience with web products, and have good vision in order to . For some functions, the website has low visibility of the system status since the icon is too small, so it is difficult for the user to spot the possible actions they can perform.
