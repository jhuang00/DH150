# Heuristic Evaluation
# Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 1 — Jane Huang

## Feeding the Mind

With the COVID-19 pendemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing unstability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.

## Analysis of Website: [Los Angeles Public Library](lapl.org)

The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is a public library system that serves residents in LA, serving the largest population among all publicly funded library systems in the United States of over 18 million residents. Holding more than 6 million volumes, the LAPL system provides books, zines, periodicals, computer access, and audiovisual materials freely to the residents. The LAPL website contains information digitally that can be accessed and viewed by the users.

The LAPL website needs to be accessible and easy to understand for all users, including middle-aged women, the users we are focusing on — middle-aged women.

In the heuristic evaluation, I will use Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design for this analysis.
I will use severity ratings to aid the heuristic evaluation. 

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation (from [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/))
The severity of usability problems can be rated from a 1 to 3 scale as follows:
Rating  | Importance  |
:---: | :---  |
1  | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
2  | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  |
3  | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority  |


#### Usability Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status
>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**Rating: 2**
* The LAPL website has appropriate and prompt response when the user hovers over something that is clickable. For example, the menu would expand when the user hovers over a tab. A tab would change color to show its responsiveness. A link would be underlined to show it is clickable.

* However, the user needs to be have experience with web products, and have good vision in order to detect every function. For some functions, the website has low visibility of the system status since the icon is too small, so it is difficult for the user to spot the possible actions they can perform.

**Recommendation:**
* Some feedback should have increased visability, such as a more drastic change of colors. Some functions should be more visible for users to find in order to make use of those functions; for example, a filter bar on the left of the screen should have more visable + (for expanding) and - (for collapsing) icons.


#### Usability Heuristic #2: Match Between the System and the Real World
>The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**

#### Usability Heuristic #3: User control and freedom
>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**


#### Usability Heuristic #4: Consistency and standards
>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**


#### Usability Heuristic #5: Error prevention
>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**

#### Usability Heuristic #6: Recognition rather than recall
>Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**

#### Usability Heuristic #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
>Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**


#### Usability Heuristic #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**


#### Usability Heuristic #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**


#### Usability Heuristic #10: Help and documentation
>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

**Rating: 2**

**Recommendation:**
