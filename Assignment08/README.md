# Feeding the Mind — Designing the Los Angeles Public Library Application
### Digital Humanities 150, by Jane Huang

### Introduction

The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is a public library system that serves residents in LA, serving the largest population among all publicly funded library systems in the United States of over 18 million residents. Holding more than 6 million volumes, the LAPL system provides books, zines, periodicals, computer access, and audiovisual materials freely to the residents. The Los Angeles Public Library Application has its main feature being the searching and finding for items in the library catalog. Moreover, there should be help documents and guidance. The LAPL APP needs to be accessible and easy to understand for all users, including the users we are focusing on — middle-aged women.
### Design statement 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

In the heuristic evaluation, I used Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design for this analysis.
I used severity ratings to aid the heuristic evaluation.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing

#### User research: contextual inquiry

The project would support the users' needs of finding the information of books or other education and recreational contents in a library system virtually and digitally.

The activity involves the needs of esteem and self-actualization, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These are the higher levels of needs, as books and other contents a library offers provide 'mental nourishments,' which can satisfy individuals internally. Individuals can not only gain knowledge, but also happiness, fulfillment, and internal peace.

The traditional solutions to satisfy the needs are more involved with the physical world, and less so in a digital setting. For example, in order to find a book they are interested in, individuals would normally have to visit a library, etc. to find the item in person, or get help from a specialist. To explore more options, one would need to rely on the recommendation from an acquaintance, or rely on luck.

However, with digital technology, books and other contents are much more easily accessed by people in the society. A website or an APP on the phone allows users to explore their options effectively. They would be able to find out a book that may be of interest to them (through book lists and recommendations on the web), find out where it is available (through catalogs), and in what forms it is available in (physical book, e-book, or audiobook). These can be done on one's own as long as the product is well designed.

I used participatory observation and interview as the research methods for this contextual inquiry study. To begin with, I employed the interview method and ask background questions to the participant. I asked about her experience with library-related topics including her previous experience with books, and her impression on libraries. I mainly used the method of observation in the middle of the study when I asked the participant to participate in some user activities on the website and the APP. Her behaviors for the activities were screen-recorded. Finally, the participant were asked some follow-up questions in an interview format. They tend to be more specifically about the activity or the product, such as how the user would rate the product, whether there were difficulties encountered during the activities, and how the user experience was.

### UX storytelling

UX storytelling allows us to dive deep into the user's stories and scenarios, and see what the roles of the product is. This ensures that our design is user-centered and human-centered. I will use 2 personas with empathy maps and their scenarios and journey maps to look at how the LAPL application can fit into the picture.

Features that the design will focus on are:
* **Search page**: clear and concise search page with search filters for users to narrow their searches
* **Results recommendation**: results page after user's search includes a recommendation section to assist users in making their decision
* **Help and documentation**: help button and documentation provides guidance and specifies steps for users to perform

#### Scenarios and Journey Maps

#### Marian Lewis' Scenario

Marian Lewis is having a headache while her daughter Lila calls for her help on her new homework. As Lila gets older, Marian finds it harder and harder to assist her daughter’s schoolwork without putting in sufficient amount of effort. Meanwhile, she has a big project that is about to launch in the company she works for, in which she is the marketing manager. She is also constantly worried about her son Marcus’ college application. Marian has always been driven and responsible, but she thinks she does not have time for this many things; plus, it’s time to let Lila figure out the schoolwork herself. She went to the LAPL application so that she can find books that can help Lila with doing her homework.

On her phone, Marian goes to ‘Catalog’ and enter in the search bar ‘Great Expectations.’ A list of results is shown. Marian can see on the page which ones are available to borrow. Also, she only looks for the copies with the ‘e-book’ tab. Soon, she is able to find the copy she wants and she clicked on ‘Borrow.’ A window pops up to let her confirm, so she clicked on ‘Borrow’ again (she can otherwise click on ‘Cancel’) and she leave the default ‘borrow for’ days on, which is 21 days. Marian wants to find another book so that Lila can have more references. She is unsure what specific book to search for now, so she types in the search bar ‘Charles Dickens’ style,’ and she filters her search to only e-books. A long list of results shows up; fortunately, there is a ‘Recommended’ section shown at the top. Marian browse through the ‘Most Popular’ list, which only has 5 books. She picks and clicks on the book Authors of the 19th Century, which is available, and she borrows it. Marian is satisfied with the books she has borrowed online, and she lets Lila access the e-books on their family iPad.

#### Linda Fang's Scenario

Linda Fang feels extra bored and sluggish staying at home all day during quarantine. She can’t really go outside except when it’s out of necessity, and doing tedious chores only make her become lower in spirits. Her children would visit her but not frequently at all. She decides to try and do something fun and fulfilling to spend her spare time — reading books. Since English is not her native language, Linda thinks she can improve her English, and it would be fun to read interesting stories. She has only been to the LA public library branch near her house twice, and she remembers having good experience borrowing books and sitting there. She has also been introduced to the LAPL application and its basic searching function. Now that the libraries are closed, Linda thinks she can borrow e-books and audiobooks from the library and access them at home by using the LAPL application.

Linda remembers that clicking on the ‘Catalog’ icon gets her to the page that she can search for books. She saw a search bar on the page, so she clicks on it and enters ‘learning English.’ A long list of result shows up. Scrolling through the list, Linda cannot find e-books since all the books she is satisfied with are physical copies shelved in the library. She sees a ‘Help’ icon with a ‘question mark,’ and she clicks on it. She is brought to a page that shows a menu. Clicking on ‘Finding an e-book,’ Linda is brought to instructions with detailed steps on how to filter results to show e-book options. She goes back to the search page, and adjust her search filters as instructed in the help documentation. Linda is now able to see many e-book options. She selected one, and follow the steps to click on ‘Borrow.’ Since Linda also wants to try out an audiobook, she looks at the help page again and follow the instructions for searching for audiobooks. She finds out that it is similar to finding e-books, except she needs to change her search filter. She successfully does that and borrow an audiobook. She is proud of herself for not having to call her kids and ask them how to do so.

### Low-fidelity prototype

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to put the concepts and the results from the user research into realistic frames. The low-fidelity prototypes shows wireframes along with interaction flows, outlining the features and interactions the project can provide. This would serve for great planning and building the skeletons of the high-fidelity prototypes and the final project.

### Evaluation and revision history

There are some iterations during the design process. For example, going through interactive details, I realized I can make my design better or correct my design by making components more visible, or by making sure the interactive flow is always smooth.

* Design with better visability — Making buttons more visible

For a screen for "Featured Search," I first used black fonts with some variations (bold) and also an orange arrow for the "Expand" function. However, the screen looks plain, since there are not many variations in style on this page, and the key elements which require interaction are not popped up enough — the orange arrows are too small. Therefore, for the next iteration, I changed the design of the "Expand" function to buttons that are much more visible and stood-out. Also, it tends to be consistent with other screens of design, as the users are used to the pattern that orange are mostly used for buttons.

* Design for good interactions — Attending to low between pages

I thought about having a pop-up notification-like introduction when the user enters "Featured Search," and I designed the interface based on my idea by designing the effect of the background dimmed when the 'notification' pops up. However, when I got back to the design, I figured that the design could potentially 'lock' the user in this screen — meaning that they have to proceed to the next screen, even in the case when they want to exit (maybe they don't want to use Featured Search after all, or they just accidently click on the wrong thing). Therefore, I made changed to my design. First, I made sure that the design included a back arrow so that the user can always go back. Also, I made the tab bar visible while the background is dimmed.

* Design with clear and succint elements — Making user experience efficient

For the "Advanced Search" filtering page, I thought for a good while how to make the interface minimalist, clear, and good-looking. I have several trials, and I first ended up with a segmented control with 2 buttons and a pull-down menu. It serves the purpose of selecting what the user wants, but I decided to see if I can make the design better. First, for the segmented control, I tried another design that is less flat, which is not only more aligned with the current design trend, but also gives the user a more intuitive sense to manipulate the buttons. Moreover, I found that my initial design lack enough visability, so I change the colors. The design of a white button with a greenish-blue background looks nice; however, the issue is that as one of the main colors of this APP, it can potentially be confusing to the user when the greenish-blue when it is not used to highlight some component but used as a background color. Therefore, the design is not good enough. I changed the greenish-blue to be the button color, which makes more sense. Also, I make sure the text color is black for accessibility concerns. Furthermore, I thought I could improve the pull-down menu by changing it to a picker. This is because it increases efficiency — the pull-down menu would require clicking, scrolling, and clicking; while the picker would essentially only require scrolling (to get the item at the center). Therefore, the design makes the page clearer and the action of the users more succint.

### Pitch video


### Reflection

The process of creating the high-fidelity prototypes was time-consuming but rewarding for me. I put in quite a lot of time and effort into creating the prototype, and it is great to see the project come into shape and have testers playing with prototype outcome. I have learned that all the work done before creating the high-fidelity prototype build great and crucial foundation. While I was working on the hi-fi prototypes, the prototypes went out naturally because there were enough planning and research done before the process. Even though I was constantly adjusting the design, it was more about the details and the aesthetics, and less about the big structure since it was laid out with the wireframes. Moreover, when creating the hi-fi prototypes, I found that I was able to achieve most things I wished to achieve. It was interesting for me to explore and make some screens scrollable while keeping some components fixed on the screen. However, there are also some ideas that I could not fully build into my prototype, perhaps due to the prototyping tool and my familiarity with it. For example, a feature which I hoped to but was unable to do is letting a message show only once for the user, after which they could specify whether they wish to see the message or not (by checking or unchecking a checkbox). These features would make the prototype even more realistic, but the hi-fi prototype works well without them, and I believe these can be better achieved in a design process in which development is also involved.

After designing the interactive prototype, and based on the feedback from the prototype testing, I would like to design the main page differently. The design of the main page currently seems a bit overwhelming in terms of the color, and although it serves the purpose of presenting the functionalities of the APP, the design is not very aesthetically pleasing. I have spent a lot of time trying different designs of the main page, but I still think it is not very satisfying. Moreover, I would improve the details of the design, such as polishing the texts, especially paragraphs of text (e.g. introduction of Featured Search).
