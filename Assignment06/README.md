# UX Wireframe — Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 6 — Jane Huang

### Description of Project

Based on the previous user research done for this project, the Los Angeles Library Application should have its main feature being the searching and finding for items (including books and various other format of library items such as e-books) in the library catalog. Moreover, there should be good compatibility and well-documented help documents and guidance. 

Based on the persona created revolving around this project and its user group, the three features that are mainly focused on are:
* **Search functions**: clear and concise search page, with multiple search options
  * Includes Basic Quick Search, Advanced Search (with filters), and Featured Search (for tailored search experience, especially for users that are not looking for a specific item)
* **Results recommendation**: results page after user's search includes a recommendation section
  * Offers the user the option to choose to browse the recommendation section, which includes featured search results from librarian recommendations, popular books, etc.
* **Help and documentation**: help button and documentation provides guidance
  * Provides help for main actions with specific steps, and the 'help' button is clearly present on most pages for easy direction to the help page

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to put the concepts and the results from the user research into realistic frames. The low-fidelity prototypes shows wireframes along with interaction flows, outlining the features and interactions the project can provide. This would serve for great planning and building the skeletons of the high-fidelity prototypes and the final project.


### Low-fidelity Prototyping

#### Main Tasks
* Searching for an item
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Quick Search method
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Advanced Search method
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Featured Search method
* Requesting for an item
  * after doing a search (of any kind of search you wish), request for borrowing a book, using the traditional method
  * Request for borrowing a book, by exploring the "Smart Recommendation” feature
* Getting help
  * In the middle of searching in the library catalog, go to see “Help” documentation for guidance, find the instruction for how to do Advanced Search, then go back and do Advanced Search

### Reflection

The process of creating low-fidelity prototypes — creating wireframes and wireflows — is interesting, challenging, and rewarding. In general, the process went quite smoothly as I was able to refer to my user scenarios and design each step of the tasks. Something I noticed is that it is not always easy for me to distinguish between the tasks, since they can have steps that overlap one another. Not having experience in creating prototypes or interaction wireflows, I was a bit unsure about which arrows to draw — specifically, for example, since there is a 'help' button designed on almost every page, I was unsure about whether it is better or not to draw every single connection from the 'help' button to the Help page. I did not choose to do so eventually because I thought it would make the wireframes less clear and the wireflows harder to distinguish.

It was quite fun and useful to let a tester test my low-fidelity prototypes. After presenting to her the task, she explores them with fresh eyes, which are beneficial for this kind of testing. Based on the feedback, I learned that my wireframes and wireflows make sense to this new user; however, I could also make some adjustments to it. For example, a feedback I have gotten is that it should be more clearly indicated on the main page that search is available when clicking on 'Catalog'. Moreover, based on the feedback, since viewing the 'Help' page often involves redirection from another page, I would add the function of closing the 'Help' page to get back to the original page the user is on more efficiently (instead of having to click the back button for potentially multiple times). Finally, it may seem unclear to a tester when they see wireframes that does not show the full content of scrolling; therefore, I would treat long and scrollable contents more carefully when designing the low-fidelity prototypes.
